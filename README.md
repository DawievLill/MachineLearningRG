
## Machine learning reading group

This code repository contains code to learn the basics of Python, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch and eventually JAX. 
#### Python sessions

For the first part of the reading group we will cover basics of Python. We will have about 10 sessions on this. The general format of the sessions follow the following scheme, 

1. Functions and control flow 
2. Higher order functions
3. Recursion
4. Sequences
5. Iterators and generators
6. Classes and object oriented programming

This will then be following by an introduction to machine learning in Scikit-Learn. 

#### Basics of machine learning (Scikit-Learn)
#### Getting started with deep learning (PyTorch)

#### Deep learning in JAX
